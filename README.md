Hello Coldtengerine here, I started learning Python in 2023 summer by taking a summer short course, and some self taught online and with Chat GPT.
I have created the lucky draw program for Christmas, surely a lot of improvement/adjustment can be made, I open Github account to share this with you, hope you found this program helpful and feel free to customise it.
